# üõ°Ô∏è #100DaysOfCoding Challenge

Welcome to my #100DaysOfCoding journey! As a programming enthusiast, I‚Äôve decided to track and document my progress in learning to code over the next 100 days. Each day, I will record what I‚Äôve learned, the challenges I‚Äôve faced, and how I‚Äôve overcome them. This journal is not only meant to motivate me to keep learning regularly but also to inspire others and share knowledge in the field of programming.

#
- **Primary Goal:** 
The goal is to acquire programming skills at a mid-level developer proficiency in front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) and back-end (Node.js). I aim to master full-stack development, including creating responsive user interfaces, managing application state in React, and building scalable APIs in Node.js. I want to develop fluency in implementing full-stack applications, integrating front-end with back-end, and working on practical projects that will help enhance my skills both in coding and application architecture.

- **Secondary Goals:**
  - Goal 1: Front-end  -> Learning one JavaScript framework (React) at an advanced level.
  - Goal 2: Back-end   -> Learning how to build REST APIs and handle databases.
  - Goal 2a:Back-end   -> Learning Node.js for server-side development.
  - Goal 3: Full-stack -> Integrating front-end with back-end and managing application state across layers.

## Daily Log üìÖ

## Day 1 - 2024-09-09
1. **Assigning a function to a constant**: Learned how to assign a function to a variable or constant.
2. **Finding elements**: Used `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll` to find elements via CSS selectors.
3. **Extracting attributes**: Used `getAttribute` to retrieve element values.
4. **The `for...of` loop**: Learned to iterate arrays with `for...of`.
5. **Adding/removing CSS classes**: Manipulated classes with `classList.add()` and `classList.remove()`.

## Key Learning Areas üîê

1. **JavaScript Fundamentals:** Deepen understanding of core JavaScript concepts like variables, functions, loops, and asynchronous programming.
2. **React Development:** Master building dynamic and responsive user interfaces using React, including component-based architecture and state management.
3. **Node.js & REST APIs:** Learn how to build robust server-side applications and RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.
4. **Database Management:** Gain experience working with both SQL and NoSQL databases, focusing on efficient data storage and retrieval.
5. **Full-Stack Integration:** Practice integrating front-end (React) with back-end (Node.js) to create fully functional web applications.
