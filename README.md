# 🛡️ #100DaysOfCoding Challenge

Welcome to my #100DaysOfCoding journey! As a programming enthusiast, I’ve decided to track and document my progress in learning to code over the next 100 days. Each day, I will record what I’ve learned, the challenges I’ve faced, and how I’ve overcome them. This journal is not only meant to motivate me to keep learning regularly but also to inspire others and share knowledge in the field of programming.

#
- **Primary Goal:** 
The goal is to acquire programming skills at a mid-level developer proficiency in front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) and back-end (Node.js). I aim to master full-stack development, including creating responsive user interfaces, managing application state in React, and building scalable APIs in Node.js. I want to develop fluency in implementing full-stack applications, integrating front-end with back-end, and working on practical projects that will help enhance my skills both in coding and application architecture.

- **Secondary Goals:**
  - Goal 1: Front-end  -> Learning one JavaScript framework (React) at an advanced level.
  - Goal 2: Back-end   -> Learning how to build REST APIs and handle databases / Learning Node.js for server-side development.
  - Goal 3: Full-stack -> Integrating front-end with back-end and managing application state across layers.
