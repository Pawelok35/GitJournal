# 🛡️ #100DaysOfCoding Challenge

Welcome to my #100DaysOfCoding journey! As a programming enthusiast, I’ve decided to track and document my progress in learning to code over the next 100 days. Each day, I will record what I’ve learned, the challenges I’ve faced, and how I’ve overcome them. This journal is not only meant to motivate me to keep learning regularly but also to inspire others and share knowledge in the field of programming.

#
- **Primary Goal:** 
The goal is to acquire programming skills at a mid-level developer proficiency in front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) and back-end (Node.js). I aim to master full-stack development, including creating responsive user interfaces, managing application state in React, and building scalable APIs in Node.js. I want to develop fluency in implementing full-stack applications, integrating front-end with back-end, and working on practical projects that will help enhance my skills both in coding and application architecture.

- **Secondary Goals:**
  - Goal 1: Front-end  -> Learning one JavaScript framework (React) at an advanced level.
  - Goal 2: Back-end   -> Learning how to build REST APIs and handle databases.
  - Goal 2a:Back-end   -> Learning Node.js for server-side development.
  - Goal 3: Full-stack -> Integrating front-end with back-end and managing application state across layers.

2. **Changing the visibility of images**: As part of the update, I implemented functionality that changes the visibility of ingredient images based on the user's selections. Now, when a user selects or deselects an option (e.g., a topping for pizza), the corresponding image is shown or hidden on the page.

3. **Displaying selected ingredients**: The result of this update is that the displayed product (pizza or salad) accurately reflects the selected options. Users can now visually see their chosen ingredients as part of the product image, enhancing the interactivity and user experience.

**Summary**: Today’s focus was on updating the `processOrder` method to dynamically change the visibility of ingredient images based on user selections. This update allows users to see a live preview of their chosen ingredients on the product, such as a pizza with the selected toppings.
